# OOP_Assignment4
The armorer has sent you another partially burnt parchment. He seems more enthusiastic, as his plea is made more concise and straightforward. He urges you to send him a second incantation, one that can automatically point out swords or daggers inscribed with Vorpal Runes and at the same time mend a number of cheap swords that have been broken by his apprentices.
He wants to see all gear whose value does not reach a spoken value ordered ascending by state. The incantation must be able to undo/redo any number of mistakes.
All incantations must be spoken in the form:
list maximumValue
undo
redo
The size of the shelves where you store the ingredients must change depending on the number of ingredients, extending as needed.
You need to use multiple tablets to keep your incantations on. (define a vector structure with a dynamically allocated array)
Write notes (specification) on your work and (unit) test everything.
Mana must not leak from the tablets.
